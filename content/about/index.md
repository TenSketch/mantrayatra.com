# Why the name mantra ?
The name Mantra is derived from Mantralaya. The place where Guru SreeRaghavendra Swami attained Jeeva Samadhi.A place of high spiritual vibration, a place which gives high inner peace. During all our tours, we strive to give you the same. A spiritual vibration, peace, happy and a at home feel. Come join in our Yatras and discover why we are different.

# About Us
With more than 12 years expertise in conducting Corporate Tours, we sensed the need for a quality Pilgrim Tour Organiser. An organiser who could tell the story, history, importance of the places.  The journey should be comfortable. The days of choultry booking is over. 5 in a room is gone. Nowadays people look for comfortable journey, stay as well as the need to see pilgrim places. With a fundamental belief To provide these to the yatris, Mantra Tours was born. With more than 75 successful and satisfying tours so far, we are more than experienced to understand the fact that – What is important to you is important to us.
